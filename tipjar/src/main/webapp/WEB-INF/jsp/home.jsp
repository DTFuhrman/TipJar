<h3>Welcome to A Virtual Pittsburgh Tip Jar</h3>
<div class = "welcome">
<p>The largest employment sector in Pittburgh is the service industry. 
As things have shut down because of the COVID19 virus 
restaurants, bars, cafes, salons, spas, theaters, and 
many other places of business have been forced to close. 
These workers were not the best paid in the region, but they 
served us every day. Because of their pay, a big part of their income was tips.
Pittsburgh alone stands to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Unemployment, retraining, and temporary assistance for displaced
workers is likely on the way, but because the sector was so huge, 
it will be a large burden on the system, and people will be denied benefits
and asked to live off of less than they normally would have.
We are not asking you to fix this crisis. It's a world wide problem.
But if you have felt powerless to help and your income is unaffected or stable,
please take the time to look through this list of affected workers who have signed up 
to signal that they are in need of assistance and join our community in continuing
to support our neighbors who always served us food, coffee, drinks, and care,
the same way we helped support them before, by sending them a tip. Just a few dollars will
let them know that you remember their service to our community, and you care about 
how they are doing during this crisis. It may also make you feel empowered, and remind you
that none of us can change the entire world, but that each of us can help hold our community up.
Thank you for visiting and considering joining our cause.
</p>
