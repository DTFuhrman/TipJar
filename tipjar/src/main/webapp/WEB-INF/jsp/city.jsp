<p>Welcome to Our Tip Jar</p>
</div>

<p>
The largest employment sector in Pittburgh is the service industry. 
As things have shut down because of the COVID19 virus 
restaurants, bars, cafes, salons, spas, theaters, and 
many other places of business have been forced to close. 
These workers were not the best paid in the region, but they 
served us every day. Because of their pay, a big part of their income was tips.
Pittsburgh alone hundreds of thousands of jobs have been affected.
Unemployment and temporary assistance for displaced
workers is likely on the way, but some people will likely be denied benefits
and asked to live off of less than they normally would have.</p>
<p>
<br>
We are not asking you to fix this crisis. It's a world wide problem.
But if you have felt powerless to help and your income is unaffected or stable,
please take the time to look through this list of affected workers who have signed up 
to signal that they are in need of assistance and join our community in continuing
to support our neighbors who always served us food, coffee, drinks, and care,
the same way we helped support them before, by sending them a tip. Just a few dollars will
let them know that you remember their service to our community, and you care about 
how they are doing during this crisis. It may also make you feel empowered, and remind you
that none of us can change the entire world, but that each of us can help hold our community up.</p>
<p>
<br>
Thank you for visiting and considering joining our cause.

First, about this website. This is not a profit making website. We don't collect any information 
about donors. We don't collect any sensitive information about displaced workers, 
not even contact information. We can't see any details about payments or even track how many
payments are made. All we can track is how much traffic comes through our website.
</p>
<p>
<br>All money is handled by dependable websites with good security: 
Venmo and Paypal. Donations are completely anonymous on our end, 
though the recipient will see your Venmo name or PayPal account name if you send them money.
</p>
<p>
<br>
This website was created by a small group of software development students in a tech bootcamp 
who felt moved to do something as they watched their friends and neighbors lose their jobs 
and livelyhoods. It's not possible for us to verify the information that people submit.
We strongly encourage you to give generously to our neighbors, but you may wish to attempt 
to verify that the recipient is who they say they are. With that said, it's likely that if 
they signed up here they need the assistance. 
</p>
<p>
<br>
If you have the means, please donate and pass this site along. If you know someone who has 
lost their service industry job and needs assistance, please encourage them to sign up. 
We need to hold each other up right now and wrap our arms around our community.

<p>If you work in the service industry, we encourage you to sign up. 
None of the information you share here is sensitive. We will just ask you for your 
name, where you worked, and your Venmo or Paypal link so that we can connect people 
who want to give you tips for years of good service already rendered.
</p>
<p><br>
If you don't have a Venmo or a PayPal you can sign up here. The process is relatively
quick and very secure. If you have any trouble both websites have decent FAQs. 
You will need to supply us with your Venmo name or the name on your PayPal.me link.
These are safe to share because without your sign-up credentials for Venmo or PayPal
neither of these can be used to take funds from your account, only to add funds to your account.</p>

<p><br>
If you have either a Venmo or a PayPal or both, you may sign up here.</p>
